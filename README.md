<li>A rapidly growing user base</li>
<li>Very robust</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The MOST delta printer is derived from the original Rostock (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:17175). The design goal is to stay as true to RepRap ideals as possible, i.e. contain as many printed parts as possible. It's a very robust design and easier to build and calibrate than most delta printers.

<h2>Easter Egg in the SCAD</h2>
Dr. Who fans will want to keep an eye out!
